E. Using branches in a Git repository is useful because you can separate certain 
tasks into specific branches so you can revert history back before you changed
certain code. Another useful reason is so if there are multiple people working
on one project, each person's code can be separated in case they are working
on different things so one thing doesn't mess up another person's code.

F. Git status displays the differences between the index file your current HEAD, paths that have
differences between the working tree and the index file, and paths in the working
tree that are not tracked by Git yet.
Git Log just shows everything that has been committed already.

G. git log --follow Weapon.h

H. git log --all --grep='file'

I. Inheritance is when classes can contain properties, or methods from other classes.
Polymorphism is when a parent class is used to refer to a child class object.
Encapsulation is when you wrap variables and methods together as a single unit.
